# Azure Well Architected Playbook and Toolkit

This repository contains a playbook and toolkit for Azure architects and engineers willing to put the [Well Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/) into practice.

The playbook is organized as follows:

1. [Cost Optimization](cost-optimization/)
2. [Operational Excellence](operational-excellence/)
3. [Performance Efficiency](performance-efficiency/)
4. [Reliability](reliability/)
5. [Security](security/)

For each Well-Architected pillar, you'll also find:

* some fundamental questions that you must ask to assess whether you need to improve the quality of your Azure workload
* a set of tools that will be useful for putting into practice well architected principles.
